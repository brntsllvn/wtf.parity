excerpt: We both need exercise.  
---

I go to the gym frequently. I like the music (my guilty pleasure is top 40 pop mashed into electronic dance tunes), but I want fitness maintenance and stress relief. So when my wife asked me to skip last Sunday's 7:15 AM class, I was annoyed.

My son eats around 7:15 AM and our guest (my dad, mentioned [here](/2019/06/24/more-housework.html)) would probably sleep until 7:30 AM and then get up and make himself coffee. No big deal: I'll be home at 8:15 AM, shower, and be social by 8:30 AM. Why should I skip the class?

My wife was irritated I'd just disappear for an hour. She explained that when our son finished eating she could hand him to me so *she* could exercise. She went on that my dad could wake up earlier than I anticipated and feel neglected if I were away.

I protested but skipped the class.

She's right, of course. Taking care of our baby is relentless, unpredictable work and any break is something we agree she deserves. But I have to exercise and my classes are [effective](https://www.orangetheoryfitness.com/).

**So what do we do going forward?**

I'm used to early mornings and suggested the 5 AM class. The drawback is I'm going to bed early in order to get up early. This means I'm less available the prior evening *or* I'm tired as shit the following afternoon (which makes me grumpy). 

What about the 5:30 PM class? This means I'm delaying family dinner and not giving my wife a chance to exercise after work.

Ok. The 8 PM class? This sorta worked when I tried it earlier this month. Our son was asleep and my wife was relaxing, but I was eating dinner knowing I'd be sprinting on a treadmill two hours later. Not fun.

We decided on the 5 AM class, and to make up for lost sleep, I sleep when my son sleeps. 

The point of this anecdote is to illustrate "equality in parenting is achieved in the details of everyday life," as [Francine Deutsch](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/people/francine-deutsch) wrote in her 1999 book, *Halving it All*{% include sup.html number=1 %}, it "exists without magic." That is, rather than steamrolling my wife by putting on my gym clothes and running out the door, we discussed it, experimented and arrived at a solution. 

We'll need to revisit this whole thing when I go back to work in three weeks, but that's the whole point: we *will* revisit it. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction.
