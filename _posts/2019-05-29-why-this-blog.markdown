excerpt: Practical parity.

Shortly after my son Adler was born in January 2019, My wife and I joined a [PEPS](https://www.peps.org/) group in Capitol Hill, Seattle. Every Thursday evening for twelve weeks we gathered with five other couples and a moderator and discussed the challenges of newborn parenting.

Pregnancy and birth humbled me. Going into our first PEPS meeting, I felt a new appreciation for mothers everywhere. But my wife and I were not getting along. I was not pulling my newborn-parenting weight, she thought, and she was nagging me too much, I thought. 

PEPS woke me up.

But my enlightenment took several weeks. Early on, one dad said "I can do everything except breastfeed the baby," heroically implying he and his wife had achieved workload parity. Being a good #feminist, I blithely nodded my appreciation for this comment. But my wife began reciting this quotation...often. Our mutual resentment grew.

At another meeting, a mom described simply walking away from her husband, forcing him to gather diapers, wipes, pacifiers, sunscreen, hat, etc., for their son in preparation for a day trip. The men all stared at the ground during this anecdote, one checked his phone.

Eventually, ["You Shouldâ€™ve Asked"](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) circulated amongst the group. At the next meeting, indignant, I blurted out moms and dads could not agree on what "really" mattered. Having accused women of inventing work, I argued that reconciling what "really" mattered would solve the problem. The room was silent.

Fortunately, Darcy Lockman's ["All The Rage"](https://darcylockman.com/all-the-rage) was published around this time. I dutifully read the [teaser](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/opinion/sunday/men-parenting.html). Intrigued, I read [another](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/mothers-shouldnt-be-grateful-their-husbands-help/588787/). Then I heard [Lockman on NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/12/722173367/all-the-rage-isn-t-about-moms-having-it-all-it-s-about-moms-doing-it-all). Then I bought the book. 

Was I just another "junior apprentice in child-rearing," as one of Lockman's interviewees bemoaned, "helping" my wife rather than partnering with her?

Yes.

I do more than my father, but despite this generational improvement, my wife and I split work 65/35, optimistically, Lockman says. When it comes to what "really" matters, Lockman answers that women usually handle thank-you cards, preparing gifts for visitors and similar social tasks. What "really" matters to me is my son and my marriage, so these things now "really" matter to me.

Lockman eviscerates every rationalization - from social to biological - for men contributing less than 50/50 in so-called "unpaid labor." But now what? Lockman offers vague calls for men to "stop resisting" and "cop" to our unearned privilege, while women should relinquish gratitude for "righteous anger." I agree, but I also want more rubber-meets-road ideas for achieving parity.

[Heuristics for Parity](/) is a collection of practical guidance.

Like Lockman, my goal is to interview a lot of couples. I want to understand what works by speaking with couples who feel they have achieved parity and report their wisdom here in actionable terms.
