excerpt: Domestic skills are developed. Feedback gets you there.

Two nights ago I lost it. 

I care for my son full-time while on paternity leave (through mid-July 2019). It's fun and relentless: housekeeping, tummy time, setting up nanny payroll, burping, pinging a potential preschool for the date of the next open house, scheduling the next doctor's visit, warming up milk, remembering to add iron to said milk, etc. 

So when my wife came home and began critiquing (e.g. "we have to remember to clean up iron he spits up by the crib or it will stain the rug", "use the scent-free detergent so it doesn't irritate his skin", "did you log his last poop?"), I could not hold back my frustration. 

I said she wasn't wrong, but her criticism was as unrelenting as childcare itself. I said her nitpicking - which, I conceded was correct in every case - was overwhelming and irritating. I acknowledged she had a point about the iron, but, jeez, c'mon, really, what's a little stain? I pointed my finger and told her defensively that, though she was right, things were fine and *she* needed to lighten up. 

It took me 12 hours to acknowledge that she'd "handled my outburst well." 

Sadly, [we judge women more harshly than men for messiness](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/upshot/why-women-but-not-men-are-judged-for-a-messy-house.html) and consequently my wife has developed "systems" for housekeeping and I have not. Put another way, my wife is more skilled at unpaid work than I am.

<small>Quick aside: This provides me a convenient (and lame) excuse: "you're good at [insert domestic task], and I'm not, so go ahead and do it." Tina Miller calls this "paternal gatekeeping"{% include sup.html number=1 %} and it is bad. Miller points out "it is hard to imagine 'incompetency' being claimed by men in the workplace in relation to workplace practices ('I just canâ€™t get my head around the routine')." Similarly, it's hard for me to imagine my defensive reaction as tolerable in a work environment.</small>

Parity requires learning my wife's "systems" (and creating my own), implementing them, screwing up, receiving feedback and [taking responsibility](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-defensiveness/).

Practically speaking, I see my wife's "systems" as skills I am developing. This characterization softens my interpretation of her feedback by couching it in terms that make me feel I am refining and improving.

My fuse is often short after a full day and rather than getting defensive I find myself saying, very neutrally, "ok" rather than counterpunching that *she* is somehow the problem. When I've relaxed a bit, I thank her for her thoughtfulness and perhaps apologize for being such a dolt.

This isn't perfect, but we're making progress{% include sup.html number=2 %}.
