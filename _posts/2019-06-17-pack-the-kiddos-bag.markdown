excerpt: Packing exercises a flabby mind.
---

In our [PEPS](https://www.peps.org/) group, one mom forced her husband to pack all their kiddo's stuff for a day outing. I mentioned this [here](/2019/05/29/why-this-blog.html) and it inspired me.

Today, for instance, while my wife was at work, I packed my son's stuff (burp cloths, backup pacifier, sun hat, diapers, wipes, dog bag for used diaper, backup shirt for me, backup onesie, another backup onesie, the waterproof bag that all wet things go into, etc.) and, 15 minutes later, after manipulating my son into our ergo carrier, we were out the door.

Packing took practice.

It used to take me around 30 minutes (including procrastination) to gather everything and jam my son into the carrier for a simple walk around the park. I'd likely forget something, like the always-useful pacifier, or leave a buckle undone, my son's arms flapping about asymmetrically. But after just a couple iterations, packing was easier.

The "Pack the Kiddo's Bag" heuristic is straightforward and I won't belabor the point: do it and everyone will be happier. But I'll just briefly mention a broader thought: **each heuristic requires competency**.

I go through a mental checklist whenever I pack{% include sup.html number=1 %}. The checklist includes my past blunders scarring (scaring?) me into remembering the pacifer, the backup shirt, whatever. This resonates with Anders Ericsson's concept of [Gladwelian fame](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) called "deliberate practice."{% include sup.html number=2 %} In short: to achieve, you must do.

Paternity leave is well-suited for doing. Jessica Grose at the NYT [says](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/parenting/mental-load.html) paternity leave makes men "feel in their bones how much work it is to manage the family in a way thatâ€™s deeper and longer lasting than just having a discussion about it." That's Ericsson's message on the nose.
