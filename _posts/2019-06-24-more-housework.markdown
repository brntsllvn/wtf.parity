excerpt: My ex-Navy dad visited for the weekend. I cleaned the bathroom twice.
---

A couple weeks ago, an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/upshot/why-women-but-not-men-are-judged-for-a-messy-house.html) popped up in the NYT about the "higher social standard" driving women to do housework. I read it, [wrote](/2019/06/12/accept-feedback.html) about it, and thought I'd digested the takeaway - **do more** - but didn't *feel* the "social standard" until last weekend when my ex-Navy dad visited.

I made a plan to straighten things before he arrived: wipe down the counters, empty the garbage and recycling, do the laundry{% include sup.html number=1 %}, and make the guest bed. The guest bathroom *looked* fine (I'd cleaned it less than a week before and no one had used it). But in the hours before he arrived (he took the 6am flight from SoCal to Seattle), I felt a pang of anxiety. Was the bathroom clean *enough*?

Nope. So I cleaned it again.

What does this have to do with childrearing and parity?

Before kids are born, most couples achieve, according to Claire Kamp Dush at Ohio State, a balanced{% include sup.html number=2 %} division of labor: about 15 hours of housework on top of 42 to 45 hours of paid work. But after kids are born the picture changes. Kamp Dush writes:

*Before the baby was born, a man’s average work week (paid and unpaid hours combined) was three hours longer than his partner’s. But after the birth of their child, the man’s total workload averaged about 8 and half hours less per week than his partner’s. Women’s total weekly workload increased from 56 to 77 hours across the transition to parenthood, while men’s increased from 59 to 69 hours.*
 
 *"Thus, over the course of a year, our calculations indicate that parenthood increased women’s total workload by about 4 ½ weeks of 24-hour days, whereas parenthood increased men’s total workload by approximately 1 ½ weeks—a 3-week per year gender gap."*

And, crucially:

*"Men added 14 hours of childcare to their work week, but did 5 fewer hours of housework after the baby’s birth."*{% include sup.html number=3 %}

The housework, driven by threat of social stigma, continues postpartum. If I shift my housework to baby stuff, aside from the "3-week per year gender gap," my wife also accrues anxiety. Parity means I have to do more.
