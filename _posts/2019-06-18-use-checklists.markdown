excerpt: Don't forget the socks. Use a real checklist.

Yesterday I [wrote](/2019/06/17/pack-the-kiddos-bag.html) about checklists: "I go through a mental checklist whenever I pack. The checklist includes my past blunders scarring (scaring?) me into remembering the pacifer, the backup shirt, whatever." I included this helpful, go-getter footnote: "An explicit checklist would make packing truly trivial, see [The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000) for the nitty-gritty."

I should take my own advice.{% include sup.html number=1 %}

Today I ran through my mental checklist and left the house, son bestrollered, en route to coffee with another dad and baby 20 minutes of bus riding away, and noticed his feet were bare. My heart ached for my son's cold feet. 

Fortunately - and this pains me - *mom* had stuffed a pair of socks in the diaper bag *months* earlier. I was simultaneously humbled, proud, frustrated, and amazed. Eclipsing this rainbow of emotions was relief. 

No more cold feet!

I created my real checklist in Trello in a new list called "Useful Checklists."

Ironically, I've been using real checklists for months and I know they work. I use one to gather my stuff for the gym and another for cleaning the kitchen. I'm stepping up my game by organizing them in Trello. I'll report on the efficacy of my Trello implementation [here](/2019/06/07/use-kanban.html) after a couple weeks.
