excerpt: While she's breastfeeding, do something useful.
---

On June 3, 2019, I kept a log of my, my wife's and my four-month-old's activities in 15-minute increments.

My log is not perfect (we don't live in 15-min increments and I'm on paternity leave), but something stuck out: In one day, my wife spent 2.75 waking hours breastfeeding (45 min), burping (30 min) and pumping (90 min). Assuming (optimistically) seven sleeping hours, that means of her 17 waking hours, 17% was just boob stuff.

Maybe she could tighten up the 90 min pumping (which involves packing pumping gear, physically going to the lactation room, pumping, and cleaning said gear) to something like 60 min (her estimate), but that's still 13% of her day feeding our child.

What would you do with another 2.25 - 2.75 hours each day?

I stay busy while she breastfeeds: I hand her things, wipe up messes, bring her snacks, sit and talk with her, do the dishes. I clean her breastfeeding gear (this means getting out the smaller-than-a-toothbrush brush and scrubbing).

Claire Kamp Dush at Ohio State found "on average, 9 months after the transition to parenthood, women added 22 hours of childcare (physical and engagement) to their work week while doing the same amount of housework and paid work as before. Men added 14 hours of childcare to their work week, but did 5 fewer hours of housework after the babyâ€™s birth." {% include sup.html number=1 %} When measuring more carefully, "men do even less." {% include sup.html number=2 %}

While she's breastfeeding, do something useful.
