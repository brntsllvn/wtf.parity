excerpt: Transform the mental load into actionable tasks.
---

*"I can’t trust him to actually remember the minimal things I ask him to do. I have to remind him to do it. Whatever the activity is, I still feel like it’s on my list. So asking him to do things does not relieve any stress for me or any responsibility. The whole idea of just having a list to start out with . . . of course he doesn’t have a list."* {% include sup.html number=1 %}

Darcy Lockman, in "[All The Rage](https://darcylockman.com/all-the-rage)," uses this anecdote to introduce the idea of the "mental load." She goes on: "Studies have established that couples intuitively, rather than consciously and explicitly, divide the work of planning and remembering. And just as intuitively, it mostly falls on wives." 

I should have a list.

Wanting to "consciously and explicitly" tackle this issue, I asked my wife to record whatever tasks came to mind {% include sup.html number=2 %}. In one day, she accumulated about 50 tasks, including "oil change," "make kidney doctor follow up appointment," and "assemble bed frame." 

Lists fail to capture the present state of any simmering task. For example, I made an appointment to get an oil change, but the oil change itself is one week away. Simply announcing I made the oil change appointment means my wife must store that datum - that is, she must keep the oil change on her list.

The whole point of splitting tasks is to *remove* tasks from her list. So, I organized tasks into a simple [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) using [Trello](https://trello.com). It looks like this...

    alt="Trello board with three columns: To do..., Doing, Done"
%}

The mental load is visible on the board.
 
 We both enter and manage tasks in one place. It's not perfect. For example, she still enters more tasks than I do. And managing the board is inherently more work. But the board enables splitting and assigning tasks and provides transparent progress updates. 
 
The board gets my brain moving. I now proactively assign myself tasks. It is surprisingly satisfying to move "Doing" tasks into "Done."

I will update this post after we've used the board for a while even if we stop using it. But so far, it is helping.

My wife verbally announced any task that came to mind to our Amazon Echo, and Alexa dutifully created a new entry in our to-do list. We both have the Alexa app on our phones and we're both logged in to my wife's account. This makes sharing information simpler" %}
