Jun 13 2019 (Armistice coffee: Brent and James on paternity leave)
+ James: accept decreased standards: don't do the dishes everyday, clean the shower occasionally
+ James: recommended Wonder Weeks app
+ James: don't hand off the baby right when partner walks in the door, give them time to relax after work
+ James: take advantage of friends and family willingness to help, this sometimes requires telling them how to help (<---- this final point resonated with me)
