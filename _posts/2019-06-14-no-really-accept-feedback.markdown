excerpt: Four days after blowing up I blew up again.

Me, two days ago...

*"Practically speaking, I see my wife's 'systems' as skills I am developing. This characterization softens my interpretation of her feedback by couching it in terms that make me feel I am refining and improving."*

I sound measured and in control. Smug even.

Me, today...

*"Psycho. You're a psycho expecting me to clean this much. No one else does this. You have a problem."*

I was complaining about cleaning coffee grounds off the kitchen counter, which are everywhere after making myself espresso. Trying to contain the problem, I bought a silicon mat. My wife asked why and argued it will not solve the problem. "You still have to clean," she said.

KA-BOOM!

That's all it took.

*You're* questioning *me*? But I am enlightened. Look at all the housework I do. Aren't I *entitled* to my new silicon mat if it even minutely relieves the "drudgery"{% include sup.html number=1 %} of cleaning coffee grounds?

The mat doesn't matter but my reaction does.

Housework is - let's face it - new to me. Other than keeping things tidy, I've coasted through 33 years of life without the societal expectation I do *any* deep cleaning{% include sup.html number="1 (again), 2" %}. A couple months into doing my fair share and I'm exhausted. My wife - understandably and perhaps on behalf of women everywhere - rolls her eyes at my flabbiness.

Maybe the mat will save me some time. Maybe not. I am naive as a new babe. My wife is not.
